# Palette
Palette is the collection of modlists developed by Ferroxius for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition

Currently available lists include:
- Little Bit of Everything
- Alpyne

# Little Bit of Everything
Little Bit of Everything (LBOE) is a modlist designed to provide a reasonable amount of gameplay improvements, visual enhancements and new content without going particularly overboard in one area

Notable elements of LBOE include:
- Gameplay enhancements through Simonrim
- A general uplift in the visuals while keeping with the artistic design of vanilla Skyrim in aspects such as Appearance, weather, etc.
- A new worldspace in the form of Wymrstooth as well as some popular quest and music mods


# Alpyne
Alpyne is a modlist aimed at providing the experience of an epic dark fantasy in presentation, coupled with a number of new additions and a gameplay loop revolving around reworked gameplay systems

Things to expect of Alpyne:
### Visuals
- Texture and mesh baselines from ANVIL
- Picta Realis covering the weather and ENB
- Environmental additions courtesy of Northern Roads, Unmarked Locations, Northern Scenery and Civil War Battlefields
- Happy Little Trees and Northern Grass covering most flora

### Gameplay
- Utilisation of Skyrim Redone for reworked vanilla systems
- Complementary mods such as magelock and mortal enemies
- Skyrim Realistic Conquering to facilitate world feedback to the player

### Content
- Expanded questlines courtesy of Jayserpa's series
- New quests such as VIGILANT
- New worldspaces such as Wyrmstooth
- New armour and weapons from Sentinel and other mods
- New custom followers as well as Interesting NPCs



Things not to expect of Alpyne:
### Visuals
- Major settlement expansions. This is to keep performance steady
- Major NPC Overhauls. The NPCs are kept in line with the vanilla aesthetic

### Gameplay
- Modern Combat Overhaul or any mods introducing new combat mechanics. I don't think things like attack commitment suit Skyrim
- Hardcore mods. Things like survival mode will be supported but the list is not built around mods such as Frostfall
- Mechanics such as religions. Not my preference

### Content
- Expansions to existing followers such as Serana Dialogue Addon. Don't really like mods such as those
- Anything remotely explicit or sexual in theme. Just no
