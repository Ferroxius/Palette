# Little Bit of Everything
Little Bit of Everything (LBOE) is a modlist designed to provide a reasonable amount of gameplay improvements, visual enhancements and new content without going particularly overboard in one area

Notable elements of LBOE include:
- Gameplay enhancements through Simonrim
- A general uplift in the visuals while keeping with the artistic design of vanilla Skyrim in aspects such as Appearance, weather, etc.
- A new worldspace in the form of Wymrstooth as well as some popular quest and music mods
