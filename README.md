# Palette
Palette is the collection of modlists developed by Ferroxius for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition

Currently available lists include:
- Little Bit of Everything
- Alpyne

# Little Bit of Everything
Little Bit of Everything (LBOE) is a modlist designed to provide a reasonable amount of gameplay improvements, visual enhancements and new content without going particularly overboard in one area

Notable elements of LBOE include:
- Gameplay enhancements through Simonrim
- A general uplift in the visuals while keeping with the artistic design of vanilla Skyrim in aspects such as Appearance, weather, etc.
- A new worldspace in the form of Wymrstooth as well as some popular quest and music mods

Alpyne is a modlist aimed at providing the experience of an epic dark fantasy in presentation, coupled with a number of new additions and a gameplay loop revolving around responsive and semi-realistic gameplay systems

Things to expect of Alpyne:
### Visuals
The visuals aim to be impressive and dramatic without being a major performance hitter. Alpyne is not aiming for a "Next-Gen" experience on a technical level. 
- Texture overhaul series from various authors such as AgentW and Clemus
- NAT 3 Weathers and Kauz ENB
- Environmental additions courtesy of mods such as Unmarked Locations and Northern Scenery
- Happy Little Trees and Veydosebrom covering most flora
- Major city overhauls. Each hold capital and minor settlement has a unique identity in its architecture

### Gameplay
- Utilisation of Skyrim Redone for reworked vanilla systems
- Complementary mods such as mortal enemies
- Skyrim Realistic Conquering to facilitate world feedback to the player
- Some restrictions on movement to encourage utilisation of mechanics such as horses

### Content
- Expanded questlines courtesy of Jayserpa's series
- New quests such as SIRENROOT
- New armour and weapons from authors such as Pulcharmsolis and 4thUnknown
- New custom followers



Things not to expect of Alpyne:
### Visuals
- Major settlement expansions. This is to keep performance steady
- Major NPC Overhauls. The NPCs are kept in line with the vanilla aesthetic
- Anything particularly "High-poly". Technical quality is kept to the same poly count and texture resolution of base Skyrim but utilising fixed or generally superior options

### Gameplay
- Modern Combat Overhaul or any mods introducing new combat mechanics. I don't believe things like attack commitment suit Skyrim
- Hardcore mods. Things like survival mode will be supported but the list is not built around mods such as Frostfall
- New mechanics such as religions. Not my preference

### Content
- Expansions to existing followers such as Serana Dialogue Addon. Don't really like mods such as those
- No new Worldspaces. This is to expand on the strength and quality of the Skyrim worldspace rather than branch outwards
- Anything explicit or overtly NSFW. Implication is present in some mods but otherwise, there is no nudity or explicit sexual encounters
